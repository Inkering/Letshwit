# An Evolutionary Approach to Timetabling

by Elias Gabriel and Dieter Brehm

## Background

Evolutionary algorithms are different from raw implementations of solutions, and are a subset of optimization problems that derive strategies from
real world speciation and evolution. As opposed to building globally-optimal strageties or combining locally-optimal ones, evolutionary algorithsm
adjust and adapt their current solutions over many generations to best fit some pre-defined desired goal. The process is intended to follow
evolutionary theory, where a species adapts its genepool over time to best match environmental conditions and maximize liklihood of survival.

Genetic algorithms phrase solution-finding in terms of those natural adaptive strategies, like gene mutation and natural selection. The solutions, which
are all progressive generations on some defined common ancestor, are ranked based on their position in some "fitness landscape." In the nature, the
fitness function is most often the liklihood to survive and procreate. In the case of homebrew algorithms that fitness could be anything, like
"how far a robot moves before falling."
