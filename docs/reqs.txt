== project description ==

In this project, you will start with a problem of interest. You will then think
about how to frame the problem and research different approaches that might be
relevant. After designing an algorithm for your problem using the results from
your research, you will implement and evaluate your approach through
experiments. To conduct these experiments you will have to set the metrics of
interest (runtime?, optimality?) and create a set of test instances.

For either project option, students will submit two main deliverables. First,
students will submit a written report. For theory-based projects, this will be
the literature review starting with motivation and following based on your
discoveries. For implementation-based projects, this report should detail
background research, explain the final algorithm, and detail and interpret the
results (similar to QMRI format).

Second, students will submit a 5-10 minute video about their project. While the
gist of the project motivation and results should be included, you can be as
creative as you want with your presentation in the video.

== rubric for assessment ==

1. Motivation: Start with an interesting and appropriate application area, question, or problem and provide motivation behind studying it.
2. Design:
For theory-based, conduct a thorough and relevant literature review. For implementation-based, detail how the design process including any
assumptions that are made and how relevant literature informs the
process.
3. Analysis: For theory-based, provide a synthesis of the results of your literature review that highlights the overall landscape. For implementation-based, validate your program using metrics and experiments and interpret the results.
4. Report: Present and communicate about your decisions and results in a clear and precise manner.
5. Video: Provide an engaging and informative video that highlights the studentsâ€™ main take-aways from the project.
