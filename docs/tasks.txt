✓ 1. do softdes evolutionary algorithm toolbox (https://sd2020spring.github.io/toolboxes/evolutionary-algorithms)
✓ 2. make a simple genetic model for testing single-point crossover with 1 hour assignments and classes
✓ 3. extend models to dynamic ranges (assignments > 1hr, classes > 1hr
✓ 4. csv importing for classes
✓ 5. csv importing for hw set (how do we go from (any homework period) to (specific hw))
✓ 6. finish crossover - single point crossover with random day and timerange mutation
  7. do fitness function
    ✓ a) how many classes overlap with any of the TODOs [elias]
    ✓ b) whether or not any of the TODOs come after the assigned due date [elias]
    ✓ c) whether or not any of the TODOs overlap [dieter]
    ✓ d) if any of the homework assignments are missing (multiple TODOs for an assignment) [elias]
    ✓ e) if a TODO overlaps with NINJA hours [dieter]
      f) test the fitness functions to make sure they're actually doing what we think they are
  8. put it all together
      a) make sure the data inputter matches the data models
      b) combine pieces into a GA
  9. experimental design // runtime plotting [dieter]
	10. report writing
  11. video writing/filming
